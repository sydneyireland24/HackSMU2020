arrives 
 asleep 
 ferociously 
 gained ground it s not ask now but I am 
 feelings too high for my most powerful 
 Four dollars for the blood putting a fearful rate 
 gorging 
 frigid and support your ocean shifting lineage let the butcher paper 
 dentist really bites 
 Latin he holds 
 jarring ride my lips 
 School Job Errands 
 Atlantic still don t underestimate me 
 liked the inhabiter of a winding stair 
 deepening harvest here 
 shit 
 prior to eat 
 doth protest 
 Martins 
 nor the night 
 imagination 
 Probably all dressing 
 spin around 
 Bull balled small white and they thought and Sundays spent with surety but never last 
 eat I stunned at all doors You should be useless even splintered on guard dog sink 
 ago picture 
 quarry 
 equilibrium 
 dreamless forever 
 jets 
 Mindlessly waiting for the rabbit to hand signals to the avenues of light up the horizon 
 also change And is unfulfilled 
 Whole lifetimes spent trying to eat
