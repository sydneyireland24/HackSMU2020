# HackSMU2020
For SMU's Hackathon (11/6/2020 - 11/8/2020) I decided to have some fun and create a program that analyzes poems, and tries to write some of its own. I am still new to machine learning/natural language processing, but half the results are really deep and insightful while the other half are gibberish and make no sense. As of right now, there are 4 options for poem writing. You can have this program make poems in the following styles:

1. Iambic Pentameter
2. Iambic Tetrameter
3. Haiku
4. Free Verse (my personal favorite - the results are either very insightful or gibberish).

This program, while it works, has a LOT of improvement it could use. It is not the best at recognizing grammar rules right now - it only has a vague idea of what words typically can follow other words. Thus, there are a few lines of poetry sprinkled in here and there that make absolutely zero sense, however they are really funny. If I had more time for this project, I would add some more code to teach the program deeper grammatical rules.

I learned a lot in doing this project, such as way to implement an algorithm that recognizes syllables, figuring out what words are more likely to follow other words in a sentence, and how to manage parallel maps. If I had more time for this project, I would have LOVED to study the structure of language more, and figure out ways to make this program spit out more grammatically correct results. But hey, poetry isn't supposed to be structured, it's supposed to be a reflection of the author's feelings and a means of expression.

Speaking of authors, who is technically the author of the poem's that this program spits out? Am I considered the author because I wrote the algorithm? Is the program considered the author because it actually spits out the code? How close is the AI takeover? These questions still leave me up at night, and they should leave you up at night too. Thank you for your time.
