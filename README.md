# HackSMU2020
For SMU's Hackathon (11/6/2020 - 11/8/2020) I decided to have some fun and create a program that analyzes poems, and tries to write some of its own. I am still new to machine learning/natural language processing, but half the results are really deep and insightful while the other half are gibberish and make no sense.
